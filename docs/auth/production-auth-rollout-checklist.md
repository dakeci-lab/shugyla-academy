# Production Auth Rollout Checklist

**Status:** Reconciled baseline **18/18 linked** (Step 22K). Smoke test **passed** (Step 22L). Auth-first frontend **prepared** (Step 22M). **Production deploy** pending separate owner approval.

## Pre-flight (read-only — completed Steps 22A/22B)

- [x] Project ref confirmed: `cxadzerxndlscwvdaymk`
- [x] Anon exposure confirmed on `academy_users`, `academy_employee_shifts`
- [x] Direct Auth-first deploy marked unsafe

---

## Approval 1 — Phase 1 additive migration ✓ COMPLETED

**Production migration:** `20260714172032_production_auth_bridge_phase1`

- [x] Production backup confirmed
- [x] Phase 1 applied (second attempt after full rollback of failed first attempt)
- [x] `auth_user_id` column exists (nullable)
- [x] FK + partial UNIQUE index verified
- [x] Both helper functions exist
- [x] Legacy anon policy **still present**
- [x] Legacy `password` values unchanged (17 nonempty)
- [x] Linked `auth_user_id` = 0 (provisioning not started)
- [x] No provisioning, deploy, or Phase 2 on this step

**First-attempt failure (resolved):** `employee_owned_by_current_auth()` was created before `auth_user_id` column. Local file reordered to match successful production apply.

---

## Approval 2 — Auth user provisioning ✓ COMPLETED

**Step 22F — owner-approved production provisioning (2026-07-14)**

Run `scripts/production-auth-users-migration.mjs`.

- [x] `--dry-run` aggregate report reviewed (`ready: true`, `conflicts: 0`)
- [x] `--apply` executed with production `service_role` (env only, never Git)
- [x] `--status` confirms all active users linked (17/17)
- [x] No passwords/emails/UUIDs in logs
- [x] Inactive users linked but login still blocked by frontend (8/8 linked)
- [x] Existing Auth user linked: **1**; new Auth users created: **16**
- [x] Legacy passwords preserved; legacy policies/grants preserved
- [x] Phase 2 **not** applied on this step
- [x] **Do not** run Phase 2 until Approval 3 smoke passes

---

## Approval 3 — Auth-first frontend + admin Edge Functions (partial — Step 22H)

**Edge Functions deploy completed (2026-07-14). Frontend deploy pending.**

- [x] Deploy `admin-create-employee` — ACTIVE, `verify_jwt=true`
- [x] Deploy `admin-list-employees` — ACTIVE, `verify_jwt=true`
- [x] Deploy `admin-update-employee` — ACTIVE, `verify_jwt=true`
- [x] Unauthorized smoke: all three return **401** without JWT
- [x] Authenticated smoke test (Step 22L) — non-mutating; baseline **18/18** unchanged
- [x] Admin sign-in + RBAC (`employees.view/create/edit`) confirmed
- [x] `admin-list-employees` HTTP **200**; **17** items; no password/raw auth fields
- [x] `admin-create-employee` negative: HTTP **422**; **0** mutations
- [x] `admin-update-employee` negative: HTTP **422**; **0** mutations
- [x] Auth-first frontend prepared locally (Step 22M)
- [x] Readiness script: `npm run verify:auth-first-frontend-production-readiness`
- [x] Deploy plan: [auth-first-frontend-production-deploy-plan.md](./auth-first-frontend-production-deploy-plan.md)
- [ ] **BLOCKED:** Deploy Auth-first frontend to production — pending separate owner approval
- [ ] Post-deploy production smoke (admin + staff login, inactive blocked, session restore, logout, admin list)
- [ ] **Do not** run Phase 2 until post-deploy smoke stable

---

## Approval 2b — Drift remediation ✓ COMPLETED (Step 22K)

**Step 22J audit + Step 22K reconciliation (2026-07-15)**

- [x] External drift detected: `academy_users` 17 → **18**; unlinked **1** (active)
- [x] Owner confirmed: legacy frontend manual add; record retained
- [x] Step 22I smoke test correctly stopped before sign-in (pre-reconciliation)
- [x] Dry-run before 22K: `wouldCreateAuthUsers=1`, `conflicts=0`, `ready=true`
- [x] Targeted provisioning `--apply`: **1** Auth user created, **1** row linked
- [x] Reconciled baseline: **18/18** linked; active **10/10**; `auth.users=18`
- [x] Legacy passwords/policies/grants preserved
- [x] Step 22L authenticated smoke test completed (non-mutating)
- [ ] **Do not** deploy Auth-first frontend until separate owner approval

---

## Approval 4 — Security cutover / anon revoke

**Owner approval required.**

- [ ] Apply `20260714210000_production_auth_security_cutover_phase2.sql`
- [ ] Permissive anon policies removed
- [ ] Anon cannot SELECT/UPDATE `academy_users`
- [ ] Own-profile policy works
- [ ] Staff cannot read other profiles
- [ ] `service_role` Edge Functions still work
- [ ] **Do not** run Phase 3 immediately

---

## Approval 5 — Legacy password cleanup

**HIGH RISK — separate owner approval.**

- [ ] Auth-first stable ≥ agreed observation period
- [ ] Apply `20260714220000_production_legacy_password_cleanup_phase3.sql`
- [ ] Password reset flow communicated to staff
- [ ] Column retained (empty strings only)

---

## Approval 6 — Notification migration rollout

**Only after Auth cutover stable. See notification preflight docs.**

- [ ] `20260713194500_notification_system_foundation.sql` (skip if tables already exist from earlier partial apply)
- [ ] Remaining notification migrations in order
- [ ] Edge Functions, secrets, rules, Cron — separate approvals each

---

## Explicit prohibitions (all phases)

- No `supabase link` unless separately approved for migration history audit
- No notification rules enable without approval
- No scheduler Cron without approval
- No `send-test-web-push` in production by default
